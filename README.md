# Investigating a dataset for weratedogs
## by Suleiman Mohamed


## Dataset

> Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of
formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. We will document our wrangling efforts in a
Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its
libraries) . The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive
of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates
people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a
denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10,
etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has
received international media coverage.
